CPU scheduling algorithms


algorithms:
------------------
 - FCFS (first come first serve)
 - SJB (shortest job first)
 - RR (round robin)
 - Priority scheduling
 - Multiple queue priority queue scheduling
 

I am going to update this with CPU sheduling algorithms along with notes as I learn in my Operating Systems class.
